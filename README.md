# ðŸŽ® Simon Game - Mini Project

A simple browser-based Simon Game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** while learning DOM manipulation and event handling.

## ðŸ§  What is Simon Game?

Simon is a memory game where the computer shows a sequence of colors, and the user has to repeat the sequence. Each round, one color is added, making it progressively harder. This mini version replicates that logic with simple visual feedback and keyboard/mouse interactions.
